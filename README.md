# House Price Prediction Model

This project aims to create a simple linear regression model for predicting house prices. The dataset includes house features (NumRooms, Area, Location, YearBuilt) and actual house prices. In this project, a linear regression model has been built using the Python programming language to predict house prices.

## Dataset

The dataset is available in the "dataset.csv" file. This CSV file contains 100 records of houses, each including house features and actual house prices.

## Usage

To get started, upload the "dataset.csv" file in a local development environment or a platform like Google Colab. You can then perform data analysis and build the linear regression model using the provided Python script.

## Requirements

To install the required libraries when running the project, use the following command:
pip3 install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib
